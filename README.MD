# Exfiltration fun using X509 digital certificates

## Overview

I spend a ton of time on exfiltration topics and mitigation techniques. This is my very first attempt to try to learn Go by having a quick way to convert a payload (reading a file) and building it as part as a custom x509 digital certificate.

Certexfil has a client and a listener and a module for encoding/encrypting (long term).


## Todo

* Actually have crypto in cryptopayload module
